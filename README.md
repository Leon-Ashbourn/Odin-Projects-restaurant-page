A spicy mix of rice, seafood, and sausage that'll have you "callback-ing" for more!

Git Burger
Layered with bacon, cheese, and special sauce, this burger is "committed" to delivering satisfaction!

Ruby on Rails Ravioli
Elegant ravioli with a rich filling, topped with a “gem” of marinara—perfectly “orchestrated”!

Ramen with a dynamic “state” and broth that’s “in sync”—you’ll be “hooked” with every slurp!

Bootstrap Brisket
Responsive brisket with “grid”-inspired seasoning—this meal is a “scale” of perfection!

API Apple Pie
A sweet classic with a “request” for extra slices and a “response” of cinnamon and sugar—don’t “rate limit” yourself!

We're always "online" and ready to "serve" up laughs and bites.

Our Wi-Fi is faster than our kitchen, and our jokes are as fresh as our daily specials. Come by and "debug" your hunger with a side of humor!
